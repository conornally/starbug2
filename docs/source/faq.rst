Can I contribute?
    Yes! Contributions, recommendations, feature requests or ideas are all more than welcome. Either contact me directly or add an issue to the `github <https://github.com/conornally/starbug2/issues>`_ page.


Can I run *starbug2* on regular fits images?
    Yes. Although *starbug2* has been designed to run on JWST images, with a little persuasion it can run on any normal 2D fits image. 
    You may need to provide some extra information that is normally located in the header file of a JWST image, such as:

    - **FWHM** 

    - **FILTER**

    - **HDUNAME**

    As well as providing PSF files and or aperture correction tables.
