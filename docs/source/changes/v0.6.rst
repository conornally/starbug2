What's New in v0.6?
*******************

v0.6.2
------

Package Details
    Sorting out some pytest functions

v0.6.1
------

Package Details
    Converting to pyproject.toml fully
    
    Moved bin/starbug2-match to a proper entry point

v0.6.0
------

v0.6.0 has mostly been fixing some methods to allow MIRI detections to work better. Mostly these are small changes and quality of life additions.

Parameters
    Some new parameters have been added, and some have been tweaked. The exact functionality of some of these are still in a development stage and the exact definitions may slightly change.

    - **SMOOTH_HI/LO**: (in prep.) New geometric parameter
    
    - **ROUND1/2_HI**: Differentiating the roundness1/2 parameter inputs

    - **DOCONVL**: Set whether to do the CONVL detection method

    - **BGD_R**: Now includes functionality to set the aperture mask radius

    - **ZP_MAG**: (in prep.) Set the magnitude zero point to be used in flux2mag calculation


Package Details
    Updated photutils requirements to 1.9.0 and used the newest photometry methods. 

    Moving bin/starbug2 functionality into console entry point.
    
Minor Changes
    Altered background aperture radius estimation.

    The command :code:`--apply-zeropoint` now uses **ZP_MAG** rather than **ZEROPOINT** as the input zero point.

Bug Fixes:
    Default matching method explicitly set as generic_match.
