*******************
What's New in v0.7?
*******************

v0.7.0
------

Matching:
    The core matching package is having a bit of an overhaul to make it a little bit simpler to use.

    -   generic_match -> Matcher class

    -   cascade_match -> CascadeMatch class

    -   band_match -> BandMatch class

    -   dither_match -> deprecated

Entry Points:
    The bin.match entry point now has the new classes incorporated into it.
    Band matching still needs a bit of work to fully reimplement the original functionality
    back into it. For now, `--band-depr` can be used to continue using the old method


Artificial Stars:
    Setting out the groundwork for artificial star testing. 

    -   Artificial_Stars class added

Minor Changes:
    -   utils.hcascade now uses MaskedColumn 

    -   utils.import_table now uses utils.fill_nan rather than doing its own thing

    -   utils.find_filter now checks meta data too

    -   utils.rmduplicates: function added for simple list cleaning duplicate values


Still To Do
-----------
-   Integrate Artificial_Stars class into starbug.py and ~starbug2

-   Do some matching tests
