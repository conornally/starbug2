What's New in v0.7?
*******************

v0.7.0
------

Matching:
    The core matching package is having a bit of an overhaul to make it a little bit simpler to use.

    -   generic_match -> Matcher class

    -   cascade_match -> CascadeMatch class

    -   band_match -> BandMatch class

    -   dither_match -> deprecated

    -   Matcher.finish_matching now takes column name for the values to go into the photometric error calculation.
        This allows the user to set whether the errors come from the std or eFILTER columns at the entry point 

    -   Verbose flag passed properly now

Entry Points:
    The bin.match entry point now has the new classes incorporated into it.
    Band matching still needs a bit of work to fully reimplement the original functionality
    back into it. For now, `--band-depr` can be used to continue using the old method


Artificial Stars:
    Setting out the groundwork for artificial star testing. 

    -   Artificial_Stars class added

Minor Changes:
    -   utils.hcascade now uses MaskedColumn 

    -   utils.import_table now uses utils.fill_nan rather than doing its own thing

    -   utils.find_filter now checks meta data too

    -   utils.rmduplicates: function added for simple list cleaning duplicate values

Bug Fixes:
    -   starbug main ncores now catches if the value is less than zero

Still To Do
-----------
-   Integrate Artificial_Stars class into starbug.py and ~starbug2

-   Do some matching tests
