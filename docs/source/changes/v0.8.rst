v0.8.0
------

Exact Value Matching:
    -   Match two catalogues together based on an exact value. Most likely this is Catalogue Number

Help Strings:
    -   More verbose help information on each routine is now displayable in starbug with -DABP -h

Minor Changes:
    -   GenericMatch.finish_matching now skips single columns

    -   It also just takes the first column, if it is a string dtype
